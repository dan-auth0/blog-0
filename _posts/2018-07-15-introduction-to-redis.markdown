## What's Redis?

Redis is an in-memory key-value store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. The project is [open source](https://github.com/antirez/redis) and it's currently licensed under the [BSD license](https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/COPYING).

[Redis delivers sub-millisecond response times](https://aws.amazon.com/redis/) that enable millions of requests per second to power demanding real-time applications such as games, ad brokers, financial dashboards, and many more!

It supports basic data structures such as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, and hashes. More advanced data structures like bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes with radius queries are also supported.

At Auth0, our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team uses Redis for caching:

In this blog post, let's explore the basic data structures that come with Redis.

## Installing Redis

The first thing that we need to do is install Redis. If you have it already running in your system, feel free to skip this part of the post.

The [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart#installing-redis) recommends installing Redis by compiling it from sources as Redis has no dependencies other than a working `GCC compiler` and `libc`. We can either download the latest Redis tarball from [`redis.io`](https://redis.io/), or we can use a special URL that always points to the latest stable Redis version: [`http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz`](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz).

To compile Redis follow these simple steps:

- Create a `redis` directory and make it the current working directory:

OSX/Linux:

```shell
mkdir redis && cd redis
```

- Fetch the latest redis tarball:

OSX:

```shell
curl -O http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
```

Linux:

```shell
wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
```

- Unpack the tarball:

OSX/Linux:

```shell
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
```

- Make the unpacked `redis-stable` directory the current working directory:

OSX/Linux:

```shell
cd redis-stable
```

- Compile Redis by typing:

OSX/Linux:

```shell
make
```

- Test that the build works correctly by typing:

OSX/Linux:

```shell
make test
```

Once the compilation is done, the `src` directory within `redis-stable` is populated with different executables that are part of Redis. The Redis docs explain the [functionality of each Redis exectuble](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart):

- `redis-server`: runs the Redis Server itself.
- `redis-sentinel`: runs [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel), a tool for monitoring and failover.
- `redis-cli`: runs a [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) utility to interact with Redis.
- `redis-benchmark`: checks Redis performance.
- `redis-check-aof` and `redis-check-dump`: used for the rare cases when there are corrupted data files.

We are going to be using the `redis-server` and `redis-cli` executable frequently. For convenience, let's copy both to a location that will let us access them system-wide. This can be done manually by running:

OSX/Linux:

```shell
sudo cp src/redis-server /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp src/redis-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

While having `redis-stable` as the current working directory, this can also be done automatically by running the following command:

OSX/Linux:

```shell
 sudo make install
```

We need to restart our shell for these changes to take effect. Once we do that, we are ready to start running Redis.
